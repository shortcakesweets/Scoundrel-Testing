        <p>If you choose to fight, you should interact with 3 cards. After that, 3 new cards are drawn and creates a new room. The 1 card remaining follows you to the next room.</p>

                <p><strong>Using a weapon</strong></p>
                <p>Weapons can reduce damage when killing an enemy. The damage that you take is the enemy rank - weapon rank, minimum 0.</p>
                <p>However, killing an enemy with a weapon makes it dull. You can use a weapon to an enemy only when it has lower rank than the last enemy that you've killed with that weapon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Using your bare fist</strong></p>
                <p>The damage you take is equal to the enemy rank. It does not dull your weapon, so use it wisely.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Score</h2>
        <p>When you interact with all of the cards without reaching HP 0, you win. The score becomes your remaining HP. If the last card you used was a health potion, its rank is added up to your score. The maximum score that you can achieve is 30.</p>
        <p>If you reach HP 0, you lose. The score becomes the minus of the sum of the enemies that you didn't kill.</p>
